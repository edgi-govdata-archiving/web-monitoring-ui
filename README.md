# web-monitoring-ui

This repository is part of the EDGI [Web Monitoring Project](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring).

This component works with [web-monitoring-db](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-db) and [web-monitoring-processing](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-processing) to support the next web monitoring workflow.

It’s a React.js-based browser application with a Node.js backend with the following capabilities:
* Consume subset of data from web-monitoring-db as proof of concept, read/write annotations
    * [DEMO](https://monitoring-staging.envirodatagov.org)
    * LIST VIEW shows first page of records from [web-monitor-db](https://api.monitoring-staging.envirdatagov.org/api/v0/pages) JSON endpoint
    * PAGE VIEW shows basic info about the latest version of that page: site, URLs and links to Wayback Machine calendar view and page versions
        * updates annotations


## Installation

1. Install Node v12.13.1
    - We recommend [installing Node Version Manager][nvm-install], then: `nvm install 12.13.1`
    - If you are using Windows, check out [Nodenv][nodenv] or any of [these alternatives][nvm-alternatives].

2. Install node dependencies with `npm`

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and supply any local configuration info you need (all fields are optional)

4. Start the web server!

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

    …and point your browser to http://localhost:3001 to view the app. If you haven't changed `WEB_MONITORING_DB_URL` in your `.env` file (step 3), you can log in with the public user credentials:

    - Username: `public.access@envirodatagov.org`
    - Password: `PUBLIC_ACCESS`

## Code of Conduct

This repository falls under EDGI's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/blob/main/CONDUCT.md).


## Getting Involved

We need your help! Please read through the [Web Monitoring Project](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring) project document and see what you can help with and check [EDGI’s contribution guidelines](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on how to propose issues or changes.


## Docker

You can also run this project via Docker. To build and run (on port 3001, as in the instructions for running directly above):

```
docker build -t envirodgi/ui .
docker run -p 3001:3001 -e <ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES> envirodgi/ui
```

Point your browser to ``http://localhost:3001``.

To run tests via Docker:

```
docker build -t envirodgi/ui:dev --target dev .
docker run envirodgi/ui:dev npm run test
```


## Releases

New releases of the app are published automatically as Docker images by CircleCI when someone pushes to the `release` branch. They are availble at https://hub.docker.com/r/envirodgi/ui. See [web-monitoring-ops](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-ops) for how we deploy releases to actual web servers.

Images are tagged with the SHA-1 of the git commit they were built from. For example, the image `envirodgi/ui:6fa54911bede5b135e890391198fbba68cd20853` was built from [commit `3802e0392fb6fe398a93f355083ba51052e83102`](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-ui/commit/3802e0392fb6fe398a93f355083ba51052e83102).

We usually create *merge commits* on the `release` branch that note the PRs included in the release or any other relevant notes (e.g. [`Release #395`](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-ui/commit/3802e0392fb6fe398a93f355083ba51052e83102)).
