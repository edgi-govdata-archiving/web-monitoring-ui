# web-monitoring-ui

This repository is part of the EDGI [Web Monitoring Project](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring).

This component works with [web-monitoring-db](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-db) and [web-monitoring-processing](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-processing) to support the next web monitoring workflow.

It’s a React.js-based browser application with a Node.js backend with the following capabilities:
* Consume subset of data from web-monitoring-db as proof of concept, read/write annotations
    * [DEMO](https://monitoring-staging.envirodatagov.org)
    * LIST VIEW shows first page of records from [web-monitor-db](https://api-staging.monitoring.envirdatagov.org/api/v0/pages) JSON endpoint
    * PAGE VIEW shows basic info about the latest version of that page: site, URLs and links to Wayback Machine calendar view and page versions
        * updates annotations


## Installation

1. Install Node v10.15.3
    - We recommend [installing Node Version Manager][nvm-install], then: `nvm install 10.15.3`
    - If you are using Windows, check out [Nodenv][nodenv] or any of [these alternatives][nvm-alternatives].

2. Install node dependencies with `npm`

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and supply any local configuration info you need (all fields are optional)

4. Start the web server!

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

    …and point your browser to http://localhost:3001 to view the app. If you haven't changed `WEB_MONITORING_DB_URL` in your `.env` file (step 3), you can log in with the public user credentials:

    - Username: `public.access@envirodatagov.org`
    - Password: `PUBLIC_ACCESS`

5. (Optional) Set up Google Sheets for saving important changes and repeated, “dictionary” changes. See the section below on [Google Sheets](#google-sheets-tasking-and-significant-changes).

[nodenv]: https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv
[nvm-alternatives]: https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv/wiki/Alternatives
[nvm-install]: https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script


## Running tests

To run all tests once

```sh
npm test
```

while to start the test runner in watch mode

```sh
npm run test-watch
```


## Manual view
Access the main view at `http://localhost:3001`

## Google Sheets (Significant Changes)

The analysis UI keeps some data and runtime configuration separate from the public web monitoring database ([`web-monitoring-db`](http://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-db)). This data is kept in 2 Google Docs spreadsheets. You can use the UI without configuring them, but you will be missing some functionality.

First, you’ll need to create a *service account* the application can use to access the sheets. To do so, follow the first half of [this tutorial](http://isd-soft.com/tech_blog/accessing-google-apis-using-service-account-node-js/). During the process, you should have downloaded a `.json` file with authentication information. Add the `client_email` and `private_key` fields from the file to your `.env` file:

```sh
GOOGLE_SERVICE_CLIENT_EMAIL=73874number-example@developer.gserviceaccount.com
GOOGLE_SHEETS_PRIVATE_KEY=-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\EXAMPLEExampleG9w0BAQEFAASCBKkwggSlAgEAAoIBAQCsBjS7qpN+vUhz\nXRhcL3pwKZtewjZ478rs7FylT+YAJMmy1wOS3ze2FVYaBHelloFromXm9gL82OCSJn1ZThePastuwGA0\npe9oZSAtiB4ujaHhcWCO7ZYZzBvsPRJZR2eo4UokDpmgAS9ExTU7zN+eKTBTFGB4\nKDc7FAxqhk9dBcYFpLU34wuQsS/SZY1j3I/pmqQ7CHnGG+KLhyRiZ6UvlT8KjWejWTFdfMoredksjfGibberishkljfkls+\nkerGibberishll7\n7oU0VVs3xY5nhkjd#r34jkd7vxjknfy3jsdhf5zjkGYfyXFNhVjsl/bJ3AHA/C9Fd5z9JmOCsZE\nyD9Yjy72C50CjOgCp568pse85A==\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n
```

In the next section, you’ll create the 2 sheets.

### Important Changes and Dictionary Sheets

Two Google Docs spreadsheets are used to keep track of changes that users mark as “important” or add to the “dictionary” of repeated, common changes. This information also gets saved to the database, but since analysts’ current workflow is spreadsheet-based, we *also* send this data to the spreadsheets. To get this working:

1) Make copies of these spreadsheets:

    * [Important Changes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S2mZKuV2v7-uec2eGA0zp3X1v1IAnoCHkLXmL-ChqnM/edit#gid=1804226491)
    * [Dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YRo1uNRRX92eSo2JiGEu50TpPVXYaLchrUVOZ3UW0Bs/edit#gid=554811086)

    Make note the of [sheet IDs](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts#spreadsheet_id) of your new spreadsheets.

2) Share the spreadsheets with the e-mail address of the service account you created earlier. You must give it **write** access.

3) Update your `.env` file with the IDs of the sheets:

```sh
GOOGLE_IMPORTANT_CHANGE_SHEET_ID=examplesdf8Za7sdft39a_osnzhJBI2dsftasdf
GOOGLE_DICTIONARY_SHEET_ID=examplesdf8Za7sdft39a_osnzhJBI2dsftasdf
```

Restart your app server and try clicking on the “add important change” or “add to dictionary” buttons. A new line should be added to the relevant sheet.
